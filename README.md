Data Science Salary Analysis
This project analyzes data science salaries from 2020 to 2023, focusing on factors such as experience level, employment type, company size, and geographic location. The analysis includes data visualization examples in R, particularly for categorical variables.

Project Overview
The primary objective of this project is to explore how various factors influence data science salaries. By examining these elements, we aim to provide insights that can guide professionals and organizations in understanding compensation trends within the data science field.

Data Source
The dataset used in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle. It comprises information on data science roles, including job titles, experience levels, employment types, company sizes, locations, and corresponding salaries in USD.

Repository Structure
data/: Contains the dataset used for analysis.
scripts/: Includes R scripts for data processing and visualization.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks detailing the analysis process.
figures/: Visualizations generated during the analysis.
README.md: Project overview and instructions.
Key Findings
Experience Level: Higher experience levels correlate with increased salaries.
Employment Type: Contract roles tend to offer higher compensation compared to full-time positions.
Company Size: Medium-sized companies often provide better salaries on average.
Geographic Location: Israel stands out as a high-paying country for data science roles.
Visualizations
The project includes various visualizations created using R's ggplot2 package, such as:

Mosaic plots to show the distribution of experience levels across remote work ratios.
Heatmaps illustrating the concentration of experience levels within different company sizes.
Box plots depicting income distribution by experience level and company size.
Bar charts highlighting average salaries by employment type and top-paying job titles.
